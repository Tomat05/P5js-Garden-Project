# P5js Garden Project

## Summary

- I originally tried doing this with a cube-sphere (essentially 6 faces, arrange them as a cube, then force each vertex to be equidistant from the centre)
as this results in a much more even spread of detail than a UV sphere, however, I couldn't find a way to force the points in.
- However, at this point I was on about iteration 8 having tried:
    - An early version of this planet thing that was extremely broken
    - 3d procedural terrain (I couldn't decide how to make it garden-themed)
    - Multiple versions of a "design your own garden" thing using a grid of tiles which then turned into...
    - Longer than I would like to admit trying to create a procedural garden generator using a wavefuntion collapse algorithm (however I currently lack the skills to follow through fully with)
    - Attempting the aforementioned cube-sphere thing before finding a coding train video on a UV sphere and deciding it was good enough for my purposes

## Thoughts

- I will probably have another go at wavefunction collapse using a tool such as Unity where I don't have to wrestle with the weird global-ish origin that p5.js uses that seems to have a mind of its own!
- I have rapidly lost sanity over this project
- Never make me touch this horrible, terrible, unthinkable library again thank ***yew***
