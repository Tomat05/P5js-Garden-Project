# P5.js Garden Project

If anyone happens to stumble across this of their own accord:
- Turn back while you still can!
- If you insist on trying to make sense of my terrible code, feel free to fork / do whatever you like with it

## Summary

- The project can be found [here](https://p5.tomat05.net)
- I originally tried doing this with a cube-sphere (create 6 faces, arrange them as a cube, then force each vertex to be equidistant from the centre)
as this results in a much more even spread of detail than a UV sphere.
- However, at this point I was on about iteration 8 having tried:
    - An early version of this planet thing that was extremely broken
    - 3d procedural terrain (I decided to switch to something else because I'm indecisive like that)
    - Multiple versions of a "design your own garden" thing using a grid of tiles which then turned into...
    - Longer than I would like to admit trying to create a procedural garden generator using a wavefuntion collapse algorithm (however I currently lack the skills to follow through fully with this)
    - Attempt two of the aforementioned cube-sphere
- Eventually I found a coding train video on a UV sphere and decided it was good enough for my purposes.
- Unfortunately, I lacked the foresight and basic intelligence to save most of the failed projects, however, the attempted wavefunction collapse (along with some random distraction projects) can be found [here](https://p5.tomat05.net) (not uploaded yet!)

## Thoughts

- If I were to do this again I would probably go for a more object-oriented approach (if only to help with readability as the current mess of functions and variables can be a little confusing to work out at a glance)
- This project can definitely be optimised but I would rather focus on projects that are more interesting and/or useful to me such as learning C and C++, and continuing to develop with C# and the Unity game engine


- I will probably have another go at wavefunction collapse using a tool such as Unity where I can learn more about it with a more feature-rich tool and without having to wrestle with the weird global-ish origin that p5.js uses that seems to have a mind of its own!
