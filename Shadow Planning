P5.js doesn't have shadows which is yet another reason why I fully indend on never using it ever again ever!

# Plan

- Directional light points in a vector
- Pixel depth shows distance of object from camera

1. for each pixel get the depth
2. create a raycast from the pixel coords along the inverse of the light vector
3. if there's an intersection, the pixel is in shadow
